This transcript discusses the need for a clean orbit for any moon around Earth, with outer and inner limits defining the moon zone. Each moon requires its own personal sub-moon zone, and the bigger the mass of a moon, the larger the personal space required. Simulations have shown that Earth could host up to seven moons as big as dwarf planet series, four Pluto sized moons, or three moon sized moons, which could result in more violent tides, different Canada systems, and a sky adorned with three bright marbles.
